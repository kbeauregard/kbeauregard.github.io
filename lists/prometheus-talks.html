Simply a list of prometheus talks

## PromCon berlin 2016
#### Prometheus Design and Philosophy

Prometheus is an opinionated monitoring system that chooses to do a lot of
things differently from traditional monitoring systems. This leads to a
culture clash for those used to other approaches, and raises questions as to
why we didn't take a seemingly better approach. This talk focuses on the "why"
behind many of the design decisions that are core to Prometheus, including
pull vs. push, the dimensional data model, relabeling, per-process exporters,
stateful client libraries, as well as aspects like metric naming conventions
and having a non-distributed storage as a design goal.

#### Scaling to a Million Machines with Prometheus

Digital Ocean hosts a public facing monitoring platform that runs on top of
Prometheus. We will discuss how we scale Prometheus up to millions of virtual
machines. How we manage and maintain the largest Prometheus cluster in the
world. Also how we do multi-tenancy in Prometheus.

#### Life of a Label

Labels are at the core of Prometheus's dimensional data model. The Prometheus
server and its surrounding ecosystem components all either attach, modify, or
act on labels in various ways. In this talk, Brian explains the entire life
cycle of labels, including their generation in the client libraries, their
transformation in relabeling, as well as their use in service discovery and
alerting.

#### The Prometheus Time Series Database

Various time series databases (TSDBs) have been implemented on top of
key-value stores with BigTable semantics. The TSDB that sits at the core of
the Prometheus monitoring system started with a similar approach and was built
on top of LevelDB. The Prometheus server as we know it today, however, uses a
highly optimized custom storage layer for bulk sample data, enabling a single
server to sustain an ingestion rate of 500,000 samples per second belonging to
millions of time series. Very recent improvements of the in-memory
representation of sample data resulted in an outstanding compression level of
1.3 bytes per sample in a typical production setup. A journey from fundamental
challenges of TSDB design to details of the Prometheus storage layer.

#### Monitoring DreamHack - The World's Largest Digital Festival

If you are operating the network for 10,000's of demanding gamers, you need to
really know what is going on inside your network. Oh, and everything needs to
be built from scratch in just five days.

#### Full Stack Metrics with Triton's Native Prometheus Support

Triton is the open source data center automation solution that powers public
cloud and private data centers world-wide. In early 2016, Joyent undertook a
project to expose infrastructure and system for every instance — including
infrastructure containers, Docker containers, and hardware virtual machines —
using a Prometheus-compatible agent. The project, called Triton Container
Monitor and described in our public request for discussion,

#### 10x Improvement for Kubernetes Performance

Scalability is one of the important factors that make a successful distributed
system. At CoreOS, we love Kubernetes and help drive the project forward
through upstream contributions. Learn how we analyzed Kubernetes cluster
performance to gain insight into cluster behavior under large workloads and
learn where there are performance issues. See how we used Prometheus for
improving Kubernetes scheduler performance by 10x.

Grafana and Prometheus is a great tandem for monitoring and visualizing MySQL
and system performance. In this session, we will go through Grafana usage,
most important metrics to visualize and how the graphs and dashboards help in
troubleshooting problems.

#### The History of Prometheus at SoundCloud

The way SoundCloud monitors its services and infrastructure has dramatically
changed over the last couple of years. Monitoring, alerting, and being on-call
is now deeply ingrained in every engineering team and we have learned a lot on
the way.

#### Prometheus as a Customer-Facing Monitoring Tool for SpatialOS Simulations

At Improbable we provide a platform for spatially distributed simulations to
our customers. We use Prometheus for monitoring our internal microservice
stack, but also offer it as a first class customer-facing system on our
platform. As far as we know, we are currently running one of the largest
Prometheus set ups, with multiple clusters of federated Prometheus stacks.
Given the nature of the simulations built by our users, monitoring becomes
their go-to tool for debugging and troubleshooting. Since our customer facing
Prometheus stack is multitenant, we have also implemented monitoring data
isolation based on ACLs.

#### Grafana Master Class

Grafana is a powerful tool with lots of options and settings. Some of them are
barely documented. In this session I will show some of the features in Grafana
that go beyond just drawing graphs on a screen.

#### Alerting in the Prometheus universe

In a Cloud Native infrastructure, failure is normal and expected. The loss of a
single node or a dozen hard drives is gracefully handled by the systems running
a datacenter and there is no reason to page someone at 4am.
This calls for an alerting system that understands service availability at a global
scope, yet is still able to give detailed reports if and when there is a service-impacting
incident. Prometheus achieves this by defining alerting conditions directly on time
series data. The resulting alerts are grouped and aggregated into comprehensive and
meaningful notifications.

#### Dynamic Monitoring with Prometheus and Rancher

Both Prometheus and Rancher have extremely active communities and were born
from the same requirement to support the newer dynamic infrastructures.

#### Deploying Prometheus at DigitalOcean

This talk focuses on how we use configuration management at DigitalOcean to
deploy and maintain many instances of Prometheus. We will discuss the benefits
and challenges of deploying Prometheus at a large scale.

#### Hadoop, Fluentd Cluster Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

At LINE, we are creating and maintaining a log analysis platform on top of
Hadoop, Hive, and Fluentd. We were unsatisfied with existing monitoring
systems like Ganglia and Nagios and recently started using Prometheus and
Grafana. We especially liked Prometheus's powerful query language, unified
monitoring and alerting, as well as the pull-based architecture. We created
Prometheus exporters for Hadoop and jstat and fluentd, and are also using Node
Exporter to monitor machine-level metrics. For access and application log
metrics, we use fluent-plugin-prometheus. This talk presents our use case.

#### So You Want to Write an Exporter

In the glorious future, cancer will be cured, world hunger will solved and all
because everything was directly instrumented for Prometheus. Until then
however, we need to write exporters. This talk will look at how to go about
this and all the tradeoffs involved in writing a good exporter.

#### Monitoring Cloudflare's Planet-Scale Edge Network with Prometheus

Cloudflare operates a global anycast edge network serving content for 6 million web sites. This talk explains how we monitor our network, how we migrated from Nagios to Prometheus and the architecture we chose to provide maximum reliability for monitoring. We'll also discuss the impact of alert fatigue and how we reduced alert noise by analysing data, making alerts more actionable and alerting on symptoms rather than causes.

#### Prometheus as a (Internal) Service

LINE is a large company with many different development teams. Momentum can be a powerful force within a company so it can take some time, training (including unlearning the old) and evangelizing to get a new system adopted. This talk will give a brief summary of our development team’s monitoring environment (Prometheus, Grafana, Promgen) before going into educating developers on Prometheus adoption and some of the struggles and lessons learned from providing Prometheus as an internal service.

#### Grafana and Prometheus

Being the default dashboard for Prometheus I guess most of you already tried Grafana and created some graphs. But have you tried the table and heat map panels? Did you know that Grafana also offers multiple plugins to visualize and show your Prometheus data? What other tricks and optimizations are there?

#### Why We Love Prometheus Even Though I Hate It

At Anchorfree we had about 10 monitoring systems of different types. It was difficult to manage, we had 0 observability, as it was impossible to see whole picture. We decided to go with Prometheus full speed, migrated all the major and minor systems to it. This was not easy move, as we faced with a bunch of problems, fundamental misunderstandings, and resistance.

#### Analyze Prometheus Metrics like a Data Scientist

Gathering software metrics with Prometheus is great and easy. However, at some point there are too many timeseries to craft handwritten rule based alert systems. In this talk I will show how to export data from the Prometheus HTTP API, show how and what to analyze with open-source tools like R, Python SciPi and describe why DevOps and Whitebox Monitoring fits so great here. As an outlook I will show how to integrate/export timeseries to machine learning services.

#### Alertmanager and High Availability

The Alertmanager is a highly critical component in the monitoring pipeline.  Operators must trust it to be a reliable component. Thus in the 0.5 release of the Alertmanager a high availability mode has been implemented. This talk will go over some implementation details of the high availability mode as well as highlight what this means for operators using and running the Alertmanager.

#### Social Aspects of Change (or How We Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love Prometheus)

Companies are (still) run by people they need to accept the technology driving the company's business. Introducing the best of technologies will lead to nowhere unless this change is accepted at all levels of the organization. This talk will cover lessons learned when introducing Prometheus into a long-established company with many organically-grown and thus highly-fragmented systems.

#### Cortex: Prometheus as a Service, One Year On

At PromCon 2016, I presented "Project Frankenstein: A multitenant, horizontally scalable Prometheus as a service". It's now one year later, and lots has changed - not least the name!  This talk will discuss what we've learnt running a Prometheus service for the past year, the architectural changes we made from the original design, and the improvements we've made to the Cortex user experience.

#### Prometheus Everything, Observing Kubernetes in the Cloud

As the industry moves towards a microservices architecture, many companies are embracing container orchestration solutions. DigitalOcean is no different. Over the course of the last year, DigitalOcean’s move towards a container orchestration solution based on Kubernetes has empowered service owners to quickly and efficiently deploy and update their applications. A vital component of this, however, is a white box monitoring and alerting solution based upon Prometheus and Alertmanager.

#### Alert on All the Things: Integrating Quicksilver with Prometheus

Cloudflare provides its services from 115 data centres in 57 countries. One of the most critical systems is a key-value store that replicates configuration data to every single machine, which we recently rewrote from scratch. As developers we were early adopters of Prometheus at Cloudflare, and this talk will explain how we set up Grafana dashboards for monitoring and Alertmanager for alerting, giving us unprecedented insight. It’ll also cover the gotchas we encountered. Like that one time when we triggered 7000 alerts at once.

#### Integrating Prometheus and InfluxDB

This talk will look at the different integrations between InfluxDB and Prometheus. We'll dive into using InfluxDB for remote long term storage. Other examples will show how to use Kapacitor to scrape Prometheus metrics targets to pull data into InfluxDB and transform it on the fly to different schemas. Finally, we'll take a look at the upcoming enhancements to the Influx Query Language and possible implementation of PromQL within Influx itself for better long term integration of the two projects.

#### A Worked Example of Monitoring a Queue Based Application

There has been a lot of work around educating people about how to instrument their applications, and how to set up your Prometheus installation to do tons of interesting things. This talk aims to address questions around which metrics provide the most value, and why. We will go through an example of instrumenting a service in production at Qubit, and explain the rationale behind the metrics we use for alerting and dashboarding. The aim is to give viewers a concrete example of how to monitor something, and highlight the logic behind the decisions made, be they specific to this service, or generalisable to almost anything.

#### Storing 16 Bytes at Scale

From the beginning, Prometheus was built as a monitoring system with Cloud Native environments in mind. Orchestration systems such as Kubernetes are rapidly gaining traction and unlock features of highly dynamic environments, such as frequent rolling updates and auto-scaling, for everyone. This inevitably puts new strains on Prometheus as well.

#### Improving User and Developer Experience of the Alertmanager UI

Alertmanager deduplicates, groups, and routes alerts from Prometheus to all
kinds of paging services. With it comes a dated UI which does not live up to
the expectations of the users, nor does it attract new contributors.

#### Staleness in Prometheus 2.0

The biggest semantic change in Prometheus 2.0 is the new staleness handling. This long awaited feature means there's no longer a fixed 5 minute staleness. Now time series go stale when they're no longer exposed, and targets that no longer exist don't hang around for a full 5 minutes. Learn about how it works and how to take advantage of it.

#### Observability and Product Release: Leveraging Prometheus for Building and Testing New Products at Digital Ocean

The pillars of observability have long been accepted as key components of any microservice-in-production. But what about those new products - those new features - that have yet to be released? Properly instrumenting and leveraging metrics at this stage is perhaps even more crucial; when a product is yet to be released, identifying and addressing early bugs is critical.

#### Life of an Alert

Alerting is a key concept to remediating issues that arise in the systems we monitor. In order to alert effectively, it's helpful to understand the concepts available in Alertmanager and how they are actually executed within the code. In this talk, I'll give a brief, high-level description of the wondrous journey an alert takes, from its triggering in Prometheus to the email in your mailbox. Then, I'll break down in-depth how alerts are ingested, grouped, and processed, including high availability mode. At the end of this exciting trip you'll understand how your configuration affects Alertmanager, what an alerting pipeline is, and why you sometimes get two emails for the same alert.

#### Hidden Linux Metrics with ebpf_exporter

While there are plenty of readily available metrics for monitoring the Linux kernel, many gems remain hidden. With the help of recent developments in eBPF, it is now possible to run safe programs in the kernel to collect arbitrary information with little to no overhead. A few examples include:

#### Prometheus Monitoring Mixins: Using Jsonnet to Package Together Dashboards, Alerts, and Exporters

Prometheus offers powerful open source monitoring and alerting - but that comes with higher degrees of freedom, making pre-configured monitoring "packages" hard to build. Simultaneously, it's becoming accepted wisdom that the developers of a given software package are best placed to operate said software, or at least construct the basic monitoring configuration.

#### Autoscaling All Things Kubernetes with Prometheus

Autoscaling in Kubernetes used to be an inconsistent concept, however using the new metrics APIs defined by Kubernetes SIG Instrumentation the monitoring system of choice can be used. As it turns out, Prometheus is a popular system being used alongside Kubernetes, and the community has already developed a custom-metrics-api adapter to be used for Prometheus. This means, we can now perform autoscaling on the cluster and application level with metrics collected by Prometheus.

#### Taking Advantage of Relabeling

Relabeling is a powerful feature of Prometheus but it is also quite specific to the project. This talk will explain and demonstrate relabeling, with some real use cases. After the presentation, you will understand relabeling and stop to copy/paste relabeling rules you don't understand.

#### Bomb Squad: Containing the Cardinality Explosion

Series cardinality can be a large foot-gun that can take out a Prometheus instance quickly. It can have similar impacts to downstream systems when using remote write. Finding the offending series and recovering from such an event can cause a large downtime for your Prometheus installation. In this talk I will show an implementation of a sidecar to Prometheus that automatically detects and squelches series whose cardinality is growing quickly. Using a combination of recording rules, dynamic metric relabel configs, and alerting, we can detect, throttle, and alert on any explosion in progress.

#### Thanos - Prometheus at Scale

The Prometheus Monitoring system has been thriving for several years. Along with its powerful data model, operational simplicity and reliability have been a key factor in its success. However, some questions were still largely unaddressed to this day. How can we store historical data at the order of petabytes in a reliable and cost-efficient way? Can we do so without sacrificing responsive query times? And what about a global view of all our metrics and transparent handling of HA setups?

#### Using the Flux Query Engine to Query Multiple Prometheus Servers

The new open source Flux query engine for InfluxDB is designed to be decoupled from storage. This makes it possible to query many different data sources, including Prometheus, with the new engine. The engine also decouples the representation of the query language from the execution representation. This makes it possible to add support for additional languages, like PromQL.

#### Improving Reliability Through Engineering an Easy-to-use Prometheus-Based Monitoring and Alerting Stack: Introducing Our Reliability Toolkit

By definition, SREs are responsible for the reliability of sites, but what if they don't own any sites themselves? Within ING, the largest bank of the Netherlands, BizDevOps teams are autonomous and responsible for building and running their services. In theory, that could make the existence of SRE obsolete, right? How can you improve availability for end customers in an environment of engineers with full service ownership? How to convince without the power of intervention? How to improve without being blameful?

#### Explore Your Prometheus Data in Grafana

Grafana is the de-facto dashboarding solution for Prometheus. Now imagine you received a page. Grafana is often the starting point for your incident response. You look at a time series panel, form a hypothesis, and would like to dive deeper. We've built a whole new section that allows you to do just that by iterating quickly through Prometheus queries while leaving your dashboards intact. I'll show-case our new Explore UI and how it can fit into your workflows for both troubleshooting and data exploration.

#### Implementing a Cooperative Multi-Tenant Capable Prometheus

Prometheus is capable of and used for monitoring large infrastructures, from corporate networks to world-spanning CDNs. But while performing excellent on setups of large scales, it is also extremely well suited for small setups due to its simplicity and modularity both in operation as well in usage.

#### Managing Grafana Dashboards with grafonnet and git

Grafana is a wonderful tool for visualizing Prometheus data. Getting started with Grafana is simple: login, create a dashboard, add some graphs, and call it a day. Come back later, add some graphs, edit some graphs, hit save and it's all live!  Flash forward a few months or years and your Grafana instance probably has tens or hundreds of dashboards. Many of them present similar data in slightly inconsistent ways. You can see who last edited a dashboard and why, but it's hard to visualize the changes they made. There's no good way to review changes before they go live like you would for any other code you write. One row on your favorite dashboard is ever so slightly taller than the others and it makes you twitch every time you notice.  At DigitalOcean we've solved these problems by storing our dashboard definitions in git, making them human-readable with grafonnet, and updating them via continuous integration. In this talk we'll describe our setup, show how it enables component re-use between dashboards, and demonstrate how it improves the ergonomics of managing Grafana dashboards at scale.

#### Prometheus in Small and Medium Businesses: Why You Don't Need to Do Rocket Science (Kubernetes) to Use It

Prometheus, at first look, can appear very simple and at the same time very complicated, in this talk will be illustrate how a small/medium IT company can approach the deployment of the prometheus stack (Prometheus, Grafana, alertmanager and exporters), start from the local testing environment and ansible roles, to the targets labeling and exporters configurations. Will be also outlined the benefits that Prometheus can give to a company in terms of metrics visibility, the easiness to plug in new systems for generic metrics collections and the knowledge sharing, without necessary be used for monitoring dynamic and complex systems.

#### PromQL for Mere Mortals

PromQL can feel intimidating at first for those new to the Prometheus ecosystem, but it is an essential skill to learn when starting out monitoring and alerting in the Prometheus ecosystem.   In this beginner-focused, demo-driven talk Ian Billett will walk through the thought processes, mental models and coping strategies he uses to tame PromQL and effectively query metrics data.   We will demystify instant vector selectors from range vector selectors, understand how aggregate functions work, and, time-permitting, even touch on some PromQL engine internals.

#### Managing Prometheus in a Security-focused Environment -- Linux Monitoring at HUK-COBURG

Prometheus offers lots of features and flexibility which often leaves newcomers with lots of open questions: Which service discovery to use? How to secure access to metrics? Which architecture to implement?  In order to provide some input back to the community, this talk will outline how we run Prometheus at HUK-COBURG in order to provide a multi-tenant turn-key monitoring experience in a security-focused environment. It covers basic decisions like scrape intervals and service discovery and extends to the implementation of encrypted and authenticated connections to monitoring targets using sshified and team-aware access to Prometheus/Grafana access via prometheus-filter-proxy.

#### Fun and Profit with Alertmanager

Getting someone to know that a problem exists is the main reason why we run monitoring infrastructure. Prometheus and AlertManager are very good at it but requirements vary from person to person. In this presentation, Simon Pasquier will introduce the Prometheus alerting philosophy. Then he will discuss AlertManager's good practices and pitfalls. Finally he will show advanced use cases.

#### Practical Capacity Planning Using Prometheus

GitLab.com’s monolithic Rails application experiences high week-on-week traffic growth. To ensure availability, GitLab’s Infrastructure team track and plan ahead in order to avoid hitting capacity limits in the application, whether these limits be CPU, database connection pools, memory, storage or any number of other finite resources. Hitting these limits could result in hours, or days, of degraded service while workarounds are put in place.  With this in mind, the team set about building a set of tools on top of Prometheus recording rules and alerts to provide them with the information they need to be sufficiently forewarned, up to a month in advance, of potential resource saturation issues.  If you’ve ever felt that you’re reactively responding to resource saturation issues, this session will provide practical examples of how we’re building a framework for resource planning into our SRE team workflow. We’ll be presenting our open-source solution and explaining how it works for us.

#### Remote Write Storage Wars

Remote write storage is a hot topic, several systems existed for a few years (Cortex, M3DB, InfluxDB) and some systems have been born in the past few months (Thanos receive, VictoriaMetrics). Each system has it's own architecture and different trade-offs.  In this talk, Alejandro will present adidas findings on experiments to benchmark various remote write open source storage systems such as Cortex, M3DB, Thanos, VictoriaMetrics and others. The experiments try to benchmark scalability and elasticity of each storage system.

#### Expectations on Remote Data

Prometheus's remote storage API allows PromQL evaluation to work with stores other than TSDB, and with data that may not have originated via native Prometheus scraping. PromQL has expectations about the data served by the API, which must be met in order to give a "compatible" user experience with native Prometheus.  I'll present my teams experience marrying an existing distributed time series database, originally designed around storing downsampled statsd-style metrics, with a PromQL evaluation engine. I'll cover topics including: downsampling, counter aggregation, series staleness, and others.

#### Two Households, Both Alike in Dignity: Cortex and Thanos

Perhaps some of the success of the original Prometheus project can be attributed to the desire to keep it simple: no dependencies, no trendy distributed systems, a single binary with a simple mission.  This approach left some problems unsolved - how do you scale your Prometheus installation across multiple sites? How do you ensure your metrics are durably stored for long term analysis? And how do you build a monitoring system that can transparently tolerate machine failure?  In this talk, we introduce two of the most popular solutions to these problems: Cortex and Thanos. Both CNCF projects, Cortex and Thanos share many components with Prometheus, but they take a fundamentally different approach to how these pieces are joined together.  This talk will help you understand the different tradeoffs these two projects have taken, give you an understanding of where each project’s strengths lie and help you decide which of these projects is best for you.

#### Prometheus at Prezi: Replacing 10 Years of Anti-patterns

This talk goes over how our micro-services infrastructure is set up at Prezi, how it used to be monitored with convoluted and unreliable solutions, how we introduced Prometheus to all of our services, what we learned, where we failed, how it improved our engineers' life and what it enables us to do now.  We recently spent 8 months redesigning our entire monitoring infrastructure, replacing 10 years of unreliable organically grown solutions to a uniform and highly available Prometheus-based platform. Our services being mostly written in Django/Python, we spent a lot of time getting in right and contributed back to the community (see

#### Prometheus and Jaeger: A Match Made in Heaven!

Jaeger is an OSS distributed tracing solution, also part of the CNCF. Standalone, it can add immense value but when coupled with Prometheus, there is a lot more to gain. We have leveraged Prometheus and Jaeger together to make Cortex 10x faster and we will be sharing our journey and key learnings.  With Prometheus, we have our RED dashboards that highlight which services are slow, and we then use Jaeger to drill down and investigate which functions are taking how long, if we’re making too many calls, if we could batch calls together, etc. We then verify the impact using Jaeger and Prometheus after rolling out the changes. Without our RED dashboards, it would be shooting in the dark to find out which spans/services we should look at in Jaeger. Usually the slowness occurs in only one cluster. To enable filtering of traces to only that cluster/env, we enrich the traces with the same metadata that prometheus has.  We were also seeing very slow queries once in a while that weren’t very obvious when using only dashboards. We then started logging the trace ID in our request logs. We picked the requests that took too long, and used their trace IDs to probe for issues with that particular request. While this approach works, you need a solid log aggregation system, and even then it’s not exactly easy to find the interesting traces (longest/shortest requests). We will show you how Prometheus helps by providing us exemplars that can let us directly jump to the right traces from the latency dashboards. We will end the talk by demo-ing everything discussed.

#### OpenMetrics: What Does It Mean for You

The OpenMetrics format intends to standardise metric exposition, making it easy for both those developing and operating systems to monitor them. It is however a new format. Will it be supported by your monitoring system? Will you need to rewrite your existing instrumentation? What's needed to transition? What about 3rd party systems you don't control? How does this differ and expand, and improve on the existing Prometheus format?  This session will cover all of these questions.

#### What the Fork‽ Reporting Metrics in a Multi-process Environment

For many years, most Ruby applications couldn't use Prometheus, because the Ruby client didn't support pre-fork servers. It turns out this wasn't solved for such a long time because it's a surprisingly hard problem. Many have tried to solve this with different approaches, but we found the best one to be the simplest. Let me show you the dark arts of inter-process communication, and how we ended up fully supporting metrics in Ruby.

Representing distributions in a metrics-based monitoring system is both important and hard. Doing it right unlocks many powerful use cases. What does Prometheus offer in this regard? And what are the pitfalls with the current state of the art? To help understand the present, this talk will also shed light on the past. How have the Histogram and Summary metric types become what they are today with all their weal and woe? Finally, let's have a look at the rich body of research happening in the area, and how it might benefit future versions of Prometheus.
