      <h4 class="card-title">Prometheus Design and Philosophy</h4>
      <hr>
      <p class="card-paragraph">Prometheus is an opinionated monitoring system that chooses to do a lot of
    things differently from traditional monitoring systems. This leads to a
    culture clash for those used to other approaches, and raises questions as to
    why we didn't take a seemingly better approach. This talk focuses on the "why"
    behind many of the design decisions that are core to Prometheus, including
    pull vs. push, the dimensional data model, relabeling, per-process exporters,
    stateful client libraries, as well as aspects like metric naming conventions
    and having a non-distributed storage as a design goal.</p>

      <hr>
      <p class="card-paragraph">Labels are at the core of Prometheus's dimensional data model. The Prometheus
    server and its surrounding ecosystem components all either attach, modify, or
    act on labels in various ways. In this talk, Brian explains the entire life
    cycle of labels, including their generation in the client libraries, their
    transformation in relabeling, as well as their use in service discovery and
    alerting.</p>

      <h4 class="card-title">The Prometheus Time Series Database</h4>
      <hr>
      <p class="card-paragraph">Various time series databases (TSDBs) have been implemented on top of
    key-value stores with BigTable semantics. The TSDB that sits at the core of
    the Prometheus monitoring system started with a similar approach and was built
    on top of LevelDB. The Prometheus server as we know it today, however, uses a
    highly optimized custom storage layer for bulk sample data, enabling a single
    server to sustain an ingestion rate of 500,000 samples per second belonging to
    millions of time series. Very recent improvements of the in-memory
    representation of sample data resulted in an outstanding compression level of
    1.3 bytes per sample in a typical production setup. A journey from fundamental
    challenges of TSDB design to details of the Prometheus storage layer.</p>

      <p class="card-paragraph">At Improbable we provide a platform for spatially distributed simulations to
    our customers. We use Prometheus for monitoring our internal microservice
    stack, but also offer it as a first class customer-facing system on our
    platform. As far as we know, we are currently running one of the largest
    Prometheus set ups, with multiple clusters of federated Prometheus stacks.
    Given the nature of the simulations built by our users, monitoring becomes
    their go-to tool for debugging and troubleshooting. Since our customer facing
    Prometheus stack is multitenant, we have also implemented monitoring data
    isolation based on ACLs.</p>

      <hr>
      <p class="card-paragraph">In a Cloud Native infrastructure, failure is normal and expected. The loss of a
    single node or a dozen hard drives is gracefully handled by the systems running
    a datacenter and there is no reason to page someone at 4am.
    This calls for an alerting system that understands service availability at a global
    scope, yet is still able to give detailed reports if and when there is a service-impacting
    incident. Prometheus achieves this by defining alerting conditions directly on time
    series data. The resulting alerts are grouped and aggregated into comprehensive and
    meaningful notifications.</p>

      <p class="card-paragraph">At LINE, we are creating and maintaining a log analysis platform on top of
    Hadoop, Hive, and Fluentd. We were unsatisfied with existing monitoring
    systems like Ganglia and Nagios and recently started using Prometheus and
    Grafana. We especially liked Prometheus's powerful query language, unified
    monitoring and alerting, as well as the pull-based architecture. We created
    Prometheus exporters for Hadoop and jstat and fluentd, and are also using Node
    Exporter to monitor machine-level metrics. For access and application log
    metrics, we use fluent-plugin-prometheus. This talk presents our use case.</p>

      <p class="card-paragraph">There has been a lot of work around educating people about how to instrument their applications, and how to set up your Prometheus installation to do tons of interesting things. This talk aims to address questions around which metrics provide the most value, and why. We will go through an example of instrumenting a service in production at Qubit, and explain the rationale behind the metrics we use for alerting and dashboarding. The aim is to give viewers a concrete example of how to monitor something, and highlight the logic behind the decisions made, be they specific to this service, or generalisable to almost anything.</p>

      <hr>
      <p class="card-paragraph">From the beginning, Prometheus was built as a monitoring system with Cloud Native environments in mind. Orchestration systems such as Kubernetes are rapidly gaining traction and unlock features of highly dynamic environments, such as frequent rolling updates and auto-scaling, for everyone. This inevitably puts new strains on Prometheus as well.</p>

      <p class="card-paragraph">Alerting is a key concept to remediating issues that arise in the systems we monitor. In order to alert effectively, it's helpful to understand the concepts available in Alertmanager and how they are actually executed within the code. In this talk, I'll give a brief, high-level description of the wondrous journey an alert takes, from its triggering in Prometheus to the email in your mailbox. Then, I'll break down in-depth how alerts are ingested, grouped, and processed, including high availability mode. At the end of this exciting trip you'll understand how your configuration affects Alertmanager, what an alerting pipeline is, and why you sometimes get two emails for the same alert.</p>

      <hr>
      <p class="card-paragraph">Grafana is a wonderful tool for visualizing Prometheus data. Getting started with Grafana is simple: login, create a dashboard, add some graphs, and call it a day. Come back later, add some graphs, edit some graphs, hit save and it's all live!  Flash forward a few months or years and your Grafana instance probably has tens or hundreds of dashboards. Many of them present similar data in slightly inconsistent ways. You can see who last edited a dashboard and why, but it's hard to visualize the changes they made. There's no good way to review changes before they go live like you would for any other code you write. One row on your favorite dashboard is ever so slightly taller than the others and it makes you twitch every time you notice.  At DigitalOcean we've solved these problems by storing our dashboard definitions in git, making them human-readable with grafonnet, and updating them via continuous integration. In this talk we'll describe our setup, show how it enables component re-use between dashboards, and demonstrate how it improves the ergonomics of managing Grafana dashboards at scale.</p>

To ensure availability, GitLab’s Infrastructure team track and plan ahead in order to avoid hitting capacity limits in the application, whether these limits be CPU, database connection pools, memory, storage or any number of other finite resources. Hitting these limits could result in hours, or days, of degraded service while workarounds are put in place.  With this in mind, the team set about building a set of tools on top of Prometheus recording rules and alerts to provide them with the information they need to be sufficiently forewarned, up to a month in advance, of potential resource saturation issues.  If you’ve ever felt that you’re reactively responding to resource saturation issues, this session will provide practical examples of how we’re building a framework for resource planning into our SRE team workflow. We’ll be presenting our open-source solution and explaining how it works for us.</p>

      <hr>
      <p class="card-paragraph">Remote write storage is a hot topic, several systems existed for a few years (Cortex, M3DB, InfluxDB) and some systems have been born in the past few months (Thanos receive, VictoriaMetrics). Each system has it's own architecture and different trade-offs.  In this talk, Alejandro will present adidas findings on experiments to benchmark various remote write open source storage systems such as Cortex, M3DB, Thanos, VictoriaMetrics and others. The experiments try to benchmark scalability and elasticity of each storage system.</p>

      <hr>
      <p class="card-paragraph">Prometheus's remote storage API allows PromQL evaluation to work with stores other than TSDB, and with data that may not have originated via native Prometheus scraping. PromQL has expectations about the data served by the API, which must be met in order to give a "compatible" user experience with native Prometheus.  I'll present my teams experience marrying an existing distributed time series database, originally designed around storing downsampled statsd-style metrics, with a PromQL evaluation engine. I'll cover topics including: downsampling, counter aggregation, series staleness, and others. </p>

      <hr>
      <p class="card-paragraph">Perhaps some of the success of the original Prometheus project can be attributed to the desire to keep it simple: no dependencies, no trendy distributed systems, a single binary with a simple mission.  This approach left some problems unsolved - how do you scale your Prometheus installation across multiple sites? How do you ensure your metrics are durably stored for long term analysis? And how do you build a monitoring system that can transparently tolerate machine failure?  In this talk, we introduce two of the most popular solutions to these problems: Cortex and Thanos. Both CNCF projects, Cortex and Thanos share many components with Prometheus, but they take a fundamentally different approach to how these pieces are joined together.  This talk will help you understand the different tradeoffs these two projects have taken, give you an understanding of where each project’s strengths lie and help you decide which of these projects is best for you.</p>

      <hr>
      <p class="card-paragraph">This talk goes over how our micro-services infrastructure is set up at Prezi, how it used to be monitored with convoluted and unreliable solutions, how we introduced Prometheus to all of our services, what we learned, where we failed, how it improved our engineers' life and what it enables us to do now.  We recently spent 8 months redesigning our entire monitoring infrastructure, replacing 10 years of unreliable organically grown solutions to a uniform and highly available Prometheus-based platform. Our services being mostly written in Django/Python, we spent a lot of time getting in right and contributed back to the community (see </p>

      <hr>
      <p class="card-paragraph">Jaeger is an OSS distributed tracing solution, also part of the CNCF. Standalone, it can add immense value but when coupled with Prometheus, there is a lot more to gain. We have leveraged Prometheus and Jaeger together to make Cortex 10x faster and we will be sharing our journey and key learnings.  With Prometheus, we have our RED dashboards that highlight which services are slow, and we then use Jaeger to drill down and investigate which functions are taking how long, if we’re making too many calls, if we could batch calls together, etc. We then verify the impact using Jaeger and Prometheus after rolling out the changes. Without our RED dashboards, it would be shooting in the dark to find out which spans/services we should look at in Jaeger. Usually the slowness occurs in only one cluster. To enable filtering of traces to only that cluster/env, we enrich the traces with the same metadata that prometheus has.  We were also seeing very slow queries once in a while that weren’t very obvious when using only dashboards. We then started logging the trace ID in our request logs. We picked the requests that took too long, and used their trace IDs to probe for issues with that particular request. While this approach works, you need a solid log aggregation system, and even then it’s not exactly easy to find the interesting traces (longest/shortest requests). We will show you how Prometheus helps by providing us exemplars that can let us directly jump to the right traces from the latency dashboards. We will end the talk by demo-ing everything discussed.</p>

      <p class="card-paragraph">The OpenMetrics format intends to standardise metric exposition, making it easy for both those developing and operating systems to monitor them. It is however a new format. Will it be supported by your monitoring system? Will you need to rewrite your existing instrumentation? What's needed to transition? What about 3rd party systems you don't control? How does this differ and expand, and improve on the existing Prometheus format?  This session will cover all of these questions.</p>

      <hr>
      <p class="card-paragraph">For many years, most Ruby applications couldn't use Prometheus, because the Ruby client didn't support pre-fork servers. It turns out this wasn't solved for such a long time because it's a surprisingly hard problem. Many have tried to solve this with different approaches, but we found the best one to be the simplest. Let me show you the dark arts of inter-process communication, and how we ended up fully supporting metrics in Ruby.</p>
